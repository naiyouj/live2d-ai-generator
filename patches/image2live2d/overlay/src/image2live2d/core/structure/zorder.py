"""Face z-order normalisation — make the expressive parts of the face actually visible.

The decomposer's depth model is not trustworthy for the face. On a real character it ordered
``eyebrow`` *below* ``face_base``, so the brows were painted under the skin and could never be seen:
driving ``ParamBrowLY`` through its whole range changed **zero pixels**. The same class of error is
already corrected for head ornaments by ``_lift_occluded_accessories`` in the pipeline; this module
does it for the face, where the stakes are higher — a brow that cannot be seen makes the brow
parameter and every expression clip that uses it (angry/sad/surprise) dead weight.

Two rules, both conditional on *actual* occlusion so a correctly-ordered stack is left untouched:

1. **A face feature never hides under the face.** Skin is opaque; a feature drawn below ``face_base``
   is invisible by construction, so lift it above.
2. **Eyebrows read through the fringe.** Anime rigs draw the brows *over* the front hair so the
   expression stays legible under a heavy fringe. This is not a guess: in Hiyori (a shipping
   commercial model) the brow meshes render at order 130-131 while the bangs are at 57 and 103.
   We only lift a brow when the front hair genuinely covers it.

Both rules preserve relative order within the parts they move, and only ever raise a part, so a stack
that is already correct comes out unchanged (the golden suite pins this).
